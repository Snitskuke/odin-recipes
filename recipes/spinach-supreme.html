  <h1>Spinach Supreme</h1>
  <!--Image of Spinach Supreme here-->
  <p>The spinach supreme is a classic recipe which takes creamcheese and butter (a lot of it) and mixes it with spinach to make a totally healthy and not at all bad for your health wonderfully tasty addition to any potluck</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 packages of frozen spinach (20 ounces)</li>
    <li>1 package philadelphia cream cheese</li>
    <li>1 stick butter (unsalted)</li>
    <li>1/8 Teaspoon sage</li>
    <li>1/8 Teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4-1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Important notes</h2>
    <p>My family prefers more topping on our spinach supreme because we love the taste so much, however it is up to your discretion how much you would like to put into the dish.</p>
    <p>When pressing the water out of the spinach, you need to work quickly and efficiently because the butter and creamcheese mixes with the spinach much more evenly when it is still hot, otherwise it will be much more difficult to mix and may not come out correctly. </p>
    <p>The best way we've found to press the water out is to fold together squares of paper towels and press into the spinach inside the collander with a decent amount of force. As you continue to press the spinach, it will condense, so make sure to "refluff" the spinach by mixing it around. </p>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To cook spinach, use instructions on the back of the bag, however it should be something like this. Bring water to a boil, typically 3/4-1 cup for every 10oz of spinach. Place spinach into pot and bring to a second boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for 8-10 minutes.</li>
      <li>While the spinach is simmering, in a second, smaller pot put half the butter in, allowing it to melt slightly, then add the breadcrumbs and sage and stir until completely mixed. This is the topping so it should be slightly moist and crumbly  </li>
      <li>Once the spinach is cooked, take a collander, line the inside with paper towels, and place in the sink. Put the spinach in the collander. Then, take sheets of paper towel and press the water out of the spinach.<sub><en>see notes 2 and 3</en></sub> You will be close to finishing pressing the spinach when the paper towels are not becoming fully soaked with water anymore and it is much more difficult to press water out of the spinach</li>
